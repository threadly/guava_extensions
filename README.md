Threadly Guava Extensions
=========================

This project is in it's infancy.  Because of that it is not currently available via the cloudbees CI system.  And it is not pushed to maven central.  Both those things will occur when this is ready for people to start using.

The pourpose of this library is to help connect Threadly with Guava.  Both projects have some similar tools, and this is designed to bridge those tools together.

The versioning of this library will match the version of the threadly project.  So if threadly is at 1.0.0, this also will be released at the same time with 1.0.0.
