Threadly Guava Extensions
=========================

The goal of this library is to bridge the gap between Google's Guava and Threadly.  For example both projects have concepts of "ListenableFuture", and "FutureCallback".  This library allows you to convert from one to the other, with the general goal to be able to use both libraries together.

Right now this project is not currently available via the cloudbees CI system.  It is also not currently pushed to maven central.  Please comment on issue #1 if this project is useful or interesting to you, and those minor details will be worked out.

The versioning of this library will match the version of the threadly project.  So if threadly is at 1.0.0, this also will be released at the same time with 1.0.0.
